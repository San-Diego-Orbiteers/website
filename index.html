The Orbiteers was created in early 1959 to fill a need for a San Diego area competition free flight club. Amazingly, in the late 1950’s, there was no active free flight club in the San Diego area. Despite claims to being the oldest club in San Diego, the Aeroneers was dead and the void needed to be filled. A group of young teenagers banded together to create the, now famous and THE oldest, continuous organized free flight group in San Diego, the San Diego Orbiteers.

The San Diego Orbiteers are proud to support our young flyers in the Science Olympiad.
